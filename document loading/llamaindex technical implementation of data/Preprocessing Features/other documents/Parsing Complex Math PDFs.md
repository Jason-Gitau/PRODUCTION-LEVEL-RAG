### Recommended Tools for Parsing Complex Math PDFs
For parsing complex math PDFs in production-level RAG systems, the following specialized tools and libraries are recommended:

- **Mathpix:** Leading AI-powered tool specifically for mathematical content. It excels in converting PDFs with complex equations into LaTeX, Markdown, or Word formats. Supports formula recognition, handwriting, tables, and diagrams. Widely used for academic and research workflows.[1][2][3]

- **GPTPDF:** An open-source powerful parser that extracts text, mathematical formulas, tables, images with layout analysis. Uses PyMuPDF for PDF element recognition combined with advanced AI models for parsing.[4]

- **PyMuPDF (Fitz):** Fast Python library for extracting text, images, and layout from PDFs. Useful for initial extraction and preprocessing of complex PDFs before applying math-specific parsing.[5][6]

- **Unstructured:** Popular library for preprocessing PDFs with support for element-wise extraction including text, tables, images, and performs layout analysis, which helps in parsing structured math content.[5]

- **PDFPlumber:** Useful for extracting tables and basic text from PDFs with moderate complexity. Works well for scientific papers with structured tables.[5]

- **Pix2Text:** Open-source tool known for multilingual parsing, including math formulas and tables, outputting to Markdown format.[4]

- **Tencent Cloud Document Recognition & PaddleOCR:** Cloud solutions that excel in formula recognition, table extraction, and converting scanned PDFs to structured text.[4]

- **LlamaParse:** Emerging tool in LlamaIndex ecosystem tailored to advanced PDF parsing, facilitating integration of math equations and diagrams into RAG workflows.[7]
