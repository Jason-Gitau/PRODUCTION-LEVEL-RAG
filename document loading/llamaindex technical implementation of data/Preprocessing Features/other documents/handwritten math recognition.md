Top open-source tools for handwritten math recognition include:

- **Math_Handwriting_OCR (GitHub by yixchen):**  
  A comprehensive toolkit for handwritten math recognition that includes segmentation, symbol recognition, and LaTeX conversion. It supports neural network models trained on handwritten math datasets.[1]

- **SESHAT:**  
  A C++ tool dedicated to recognizing handwritten math expressions, converting stroke data into structured formats like LaTeX or MathML. Suitable for pen-input or tablet-based handwriting recognition.[2]

- **Recognition and Classification of Handwritten Math Symbols:**  
  A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based system trained on 82 math symbol classes achieving high accuracy for symbol-level recognition, ideal for building larger recognition systems.[3]

- **Im2Latex-100k:**  
  An open-source dataset and related models for recognizing handwritten math in images, often used with neural network architectures for end-to-end formula recognition.

- **PyLaTeXMath OCR:**  
  An emerging open-source project focusing on extracting handwritten math and converting it into LaTeX format with decent accuracy.

These tools leverage deep learning, stroke analysis, and image processing techniques focused on handwritten mathematical content, making them well-suited for integration into production systems requiring handwritten math recognition.[1][2][3]
