The best open-source libraries for recognizing math symbols include:

- **SESHAT:**  
  A C++ open-source system specialized in recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions. It converts stroke sequences into LaTeX, InkML, or MathML. Itâ€™s notable for handling complex hand-drawn math.[1]

- **Pix2Text (Pix2Tex-MFR):**  
  An open-source deep learning model converting images of mathematical formulas to LaTeX text. It uses advanced architectures like TrOCR and is optimized for formula recognition in images.[2]

- **Math_Handwriting_OCR (GitHub by yixchen):**  
  A collection of tools and models focused on handwritten math OCR, including segmentation and parser modules, useful for math symbol recognition in handwritten data.[3]

- **Mathematical-Symbol-Recognition (GitHub by wolframhwang):**  
  Contains deep learning approaches using TensorFlow and other libraries for recognizing math symbols, useful for mathematical formula recognition and classification.[4]

- **Texify:**  
  An OCR model converting math images or PDFs into Markdown and LaTeX, handling both block and inline math. It supports CPU, GPU, and runs open-source.[5]

- **Recognition and Classification of Handwritten Math Symbols (CNN-based):**  
  An open deep learning-based web app classifying 82 math symbol classes, achieving around 91.5% accuracy, useful as a basis for math symbol recognition.[6]

Additional libraries like PyMuPDF, PDFPlumber, and Unstructured assist in extracting raw data but are not math-symbol-specific.

These open-source projects provide strong foundations for math symbol recognition whether dealing with handwriting or printed formulas for integration into production RAG systems.[1][3][4][2][5][6]
