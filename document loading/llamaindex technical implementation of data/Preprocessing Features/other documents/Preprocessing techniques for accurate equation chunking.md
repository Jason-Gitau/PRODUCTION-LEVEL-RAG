### Key Techniques for Accurate Equation Chunking
Preprocessing techniques that enable accurate equation chunking in production RAG systems include:

- **Equation Boundary Detection:**  
  Use math-aware parsers or regular expressions to precisely identify start and end points of equations, ensuring chunk boundaries do not split equations.

- **Semantic Segmentation:**  
  Apply NLP models tailored to mathematical text to segment documents by semantic units such as definitions, theorems, proofs, and formulas, grouping related equations with explanatory text.

- **Preserve Mathematical Structure:**  
  Convert equations into structured formats like LaTeX or MathML during preprocessing, allowing chunkers to treat the entire equation as a single atomic semantic unit.

- **Overlapping Chunks:**  
  Implement overlap between chunks in regions around equations to preserve context and avoid information loss at chunk edges.

- **Hierarchical Chunking:**  
  Use multi-level chunking where smaller chunks contain atomic equations and larger chunks group these into meaningful sections or proofs for retrieval flexibility.

- **Layout and Visual Cues:**  
  Use document layout analysis from tools like PyMuPDF or LlamaParse to detect blocks visually separated (e.g., equation centered on a line) to guide chunk boundaries.

- **Preserve Inline Equations:**  
  Handle inline vs display equations differently, ensuring inline math is contained within text chunks while complex display equations get isolated.

- **Chunk Metadata Tagging:**  
  Tag chunks containing equations explicitly with metadata to facilitate special handling during retrieval and generation (e.g., render math correctly).

### Summary

These preprocessing techniques ensure that mathematical equations are chunked without loss or split, maintaining semantic integrity and context for precise retrieval and reasoning in RAG systems specialized in math-heavy documents.[1][2][3][4]
